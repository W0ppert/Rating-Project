WARN: <resource-bundle>com.jetbrains.webstorm.WebstormBundle</resource-bundle> tag is found in an xml descriptor included into the platform part of the IDE but the platform part uses predefined bundles (e.g. ActionsBundle for actions) anyway; this tag must be replaced by a corresponding attribute in some inner tags (e.g. by 'resource-bundle' attribute in 'actions' tag)
